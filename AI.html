            <h2>AI in Everyday Life</h2>
            <p>Welcome to a journey through the integration of Artificial Intelligence in our daily lives. As a Computer Science student fascinated by the power and potential of AI and machine learning, I've created this space to share insights and demonstrate how these technologies shape our world. From simplifying tasks to solving complex problems, AI's invisible hand is increasingly influential. Here, we'll explore interactive examples that illustrate AI's impact and discuss its future implications. Join me in uncovering the seamless integration of AI into our routines, often in ways we barely notice.</p>

                <div class="prompt-box">
                    <p class="prompt-text">Original Prompt: "Generate a creative page that I can add to my personal website as a showcase for a Computer Science student. I have provided you with the skeleton code that I am currently using for the page, the front page for context on the website, as well as the current stylesheets in use. style.css is the "light mode" stylesheet and style2.css is the "dark mode" stylesheet, list any additions/changes that I will need to make in both stylesheets and ensure that your design complements the current theme of the page well. Include as part of the page a section where I can leave a copy of this chat thread to be viewed by page visitors to see this prompt and subsequent messages that went into creating the page. You have complete creative freedom over the content of the page, however maintain a strong professional presence. Consider I already have pages showcasing my personal abilities/skills/portfolio so you will need to think outside the box for page ideas, and the more creative the better. For your first output, I want you to simply give me an outline for the structure of the page, as well as what the HTML code would look like for said structure, remember that I have uploaded AI.html for you which is the current template for the page."</p>
