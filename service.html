                    <p class="serviceDescription">For the past three years that I have spent at TAMU, I have actively participated in the Big Event, the largest single day, student run service project in the nation.
                        As a committed volunteer with other members from my student organizations, I've contributed to various community service tasks ranging from yard work for local residents, to assisting in community centers,
                        embodying the Aggie spirit of selfless service. This annual tradition has not only allowed me to give back to the BCS community, but has also enriched my university experience, fostering a sense of camaraderie and Aggie pride.

                    <p class="serviceDescription">Throughout my time in college, I have also been involved in volunteering for the MS 150 bike race in College Station as part of my fraternity's commitment to community service. Our efforts were
                        focused on supporting participants and organizers, from setting up rest stops to providing encouragement and logistical help thorughout the race when it was needed. This experience not only allowed me to contribute to a great cause
                        (raising funds and awareness for multiple sclerosis), but also strengthened the bonds between by brothers and I, and the community at large.
